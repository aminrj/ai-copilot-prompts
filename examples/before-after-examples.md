# ðŸŽ¯ Typical Usage Scenarios for ai-copilot-prompts

Let me walk you through how a real developer would use this repository in their daily workflow.

## **Scenario 1: The Monday Morning Feature Implementation**

**Context:** Sarah, a senior developer, gets assigned to build a payment processing system for their e-commerce platform.

### **Traditional Approach (Without the repo):**

```
9:00 AM - Opens VS Code
9:05 AM - Types: "Create a payment processing function"
9:06 AM - AI returns basic skeleton code
9:07 AM - Realizes it's missing error handling, security, testing
9:08 AM - Starts manually adding pieces one by one
12:00 PM - Still debugging edge cases and security issues
```

### **With ai-copilot-prompts:**

```
9:00 AM - Opens VS Code
9:01 AM - Goes to github.com/molntek/ai-copilot-prompts
9:02 AM - Navigates to prompts/01-foundation/context-loading.md
9:03 AM - Copies the template, fills in her project context:
```

```markdown
Context for Payment Processing System:

## Project Information

- Tech Stack: React + Node.js + PostgreSQL
- Architecture: Microservices with API Gateway
- Scale: 10k transactions/day, targeting 100k
- Team Size: 6 developers
- Timeline: 2 weeks to production

## Technical Context

- Existing Patterns: See /src/services/OrderService.js for patterns
- Dependencies: Stripe API, Redis for caching, PostgreSQL
- Constraints: PCI compliance required, <200ms response time
- Integration Points: Order service, Email service, Analytics

## Business Context

- User Type: E-commerce customers (B2C)
- Success Criteria: 99.9% success rate, zero data breaches
- Edge Cases: Failed payments, disputed charges, refunds
- Compliance: PCI-DSS Level 1, GDPR for EU customers

## Implementation Requirements

Task: Implement complete Stripe payment processing with webhooks

Must Include:

- PCI-compliant card data handling (no storage)
- Idempotency for preventing double charges
- Comprehensive webhook signature verification
- Complete error handling and user feedback
- Audit logging for compliance
- Retry logic for failed API calls
- Performance monitoring integration

Think through:

- What happens if Stripe is down?
- How do we handle disputed payments?
- What if webhooks fail to deliver?
- How do we ensure PCI compliance?
- How do we test this thoroughly?

Provide production-ready implementation with security best practices.
```

```
9:08 AM - Pastes enhanced prompt into GitHub Copilot
9:10 AM - AI returns complete payment system with:
         âœ… Stripe integration with proper error handling
         âœ… Webhook verification and processing
         âœ… Idempotency key implementation
         âœ… PCI-compliant architecture
         âœ… Comprehensive testing strategy
         âœ… Monitoring and logging setup
10:30 AM - Reviews and tests the generated code
11:00 AM - Payment system working in staging environment
```

**Time Saved: 4-6 hours**
**Quality Improvement: Production-ready vs basic prototype**

## **Scenario 2: The Friday Afternoon Bug Hunt**

**Context:** Marcus gets a production alert - the user search API is returning 500 errors intermittently.

### **Without the repo:**

```
3:30 PM - Gets alert about search API failures
3:35 PM - Starts randomly checking logs
4:00 PM - Still unclear what's causing the issue
4:30 PM - Tries various debugging approaches
5:30 PM - Weekend ruined, issue still not resolved
```

### **With ai-copilot-prompts:**

```
3:30 PM - Gets production alert
3:32 PM - Opens prompts/02-debugging/systematic-analysis.md
3:33 PM - Uses the template to structure investigation:
```

```markdown
Debug this issue systematically:

## Problem Statement

Issue: User search API returns 500 errors intermittently
Expected Behavior: All search requests return 200 with results
Actual Behavior: ~12% of search requests return 500 "Internal Server Error"
Environment: Production
Frequency: 12% of requests, seems random
Impact: Users can't find products, search abandonment at 40%

## Current State Investigation

### Immediate Symptoms

- Error Messages: "Error: connect ETIMEDOUT" in application logs
- Log Entries: 2025-01-15 15:25:30 ERROR Connection pool exhausted
- User Reports: "Search not working" complaints increasing
- System Metrics: Database connections at 95/100 max

### Reproduction Information

- Steps to Reproduce: Search for any product during peak hours
- Required Conditions: High load (>50 concurrent searches)
- Success Rate: 88% success, 12% failure
- Pattern: Failures correlate with high traffic periods

## Context Analysis

### Recent Changes

- Code Deployments: Search service v1.4.2 deployed yesterday
- Configuration Changes: Added product recommendation feature
- Load Patterns: 30% traffic increase since yesterday's feature launch

[Continues with systematic investigation...]
```

```
3:40 PM - Pastes debugging prompt into Claude Code
3:45 PM - AI provides systematic analysis:
         âœ… Identifies connection pool exhaustion as root cause
         âœ… Traces issue to new recommendation feature making extra DB calls
         âœ… Provides immediate fix (increase pool size)
         âœ… Suggests proper long-term solution (optimize queries)
         âœ… Includes monitoring improvements
4:00 PM - Deploys hotfix increasing connection pool
4:15 PM - Confirms error rate dropped to <1%
4:30 PM - Documents incident and prevention plan
```

**Time Saved: 3-4 hours**
**Weekend Saved: Priceless**

## **Scenario 3: The Architecture Review**

**Context:** Emma needs to design a real-time chat system for their collaboration platform.

### **Traditional approach:**

```
Week 1: Research different chat architectures
Week 2: Design system architecture
Week 3: Create technical specifications
Week 4: Present to team, get feedback, revise
```

### **With ai-copilot-prompts:**

```
Day 1: Opens prompts/03-architecture/system-design.md
       Fills in requirements for chat system
       Gets comprehensive architecture in 2 hours
Day 2: Reviews and refines the AI-generated design
Day 3: Presents polished architecture to team
```

**Sample usage:**

```markdown
Design a complete system for Real-time Chat Application:

## **Scenario 4: The Code Review Enhancement**

**Context:** James wants to improve his team's code review process using AI.

### **Usage:**

```
1. Opens prompts/05-team/code-review.md
2. Copies comprehensive review template
3. Uses with GitHub Copilot before every PR submission
```

**Example pre-review prompt:**

```markdown
Perform a senior-level code review on this implementation:

[Pastes his payment processing code]

Context:

- Feature: Stripe payment integration for subscription billing
- Performance requirements: Handle 1000 payments/hour
- Security sensitivity: PCI compliance required
- Team standards: Follow existing error handling patterns

Review for:

1. Logic correctness and edge cases
2. Security vulnerabilities and PCI compliance
3. Performance implications at scale
4. Error handling completeness
5. Test coverage gaps
6. Code maintainability

Provide specific fixes for each issue found.
```

**Result:** AI identifies 8 potential issues including:

- Missing idempotency key handling
- Insufficient error logging for audit
- Performance issue with sync webhook processing
- Missing test cases for failure scenarios

**Impact:**

- **Before:** 3-4 review cycles per PR
- **After:** 1-2 review cycles per PR
- **Team velocity:** 40% faster feature delivery

## **Scenario 5: The Learning Developer**

**Context:** Alex is a junior developer learning to work with AI tools effectively.

### **Discovery Journey:**

```
Week 1: Discovers repo through Reddit r/programming
Week 2: Starts with foundation prompts (context-loading, think-step-by-step)
Week 3: Notices significant improvement in AI output quality
Week 4: Tries advanced techniques (time-traveler, chaos engineering)
Month 2: Contributing own prompts back to the repository
Month 3: Becomes team's "AI expert", teaches others these techniques
```

### **Typical Learning Session:**

```
Monday: Uses error-first-development.md for login feature
- Before: AI generates basic auth code
- After: AI generates production-ready auth with comprehensive error handling

Tuesday: Applies systematic-analysis.md to debug performance issue
- Before: Random debugging, takes hours
- After: Structured investigation, finds root cause in 30 minutes

Wednesday: Uses time-traveler.md technique on existing code
- Before: Code works but may have future issues
- After: Code is future-proofed with modern security practices
```
